If you know how to get something similar working on Wayland, please let me know!.
Requires **xdotool** from your favourite package manager. xdotool will generate a bit of system log spam. 

### Usage
Just run the script in a terminal. It searches for the right window and clicks the 'Accept' Button by pressing the keyboard shortcut Alt+a. I suggest you add the script to your autostart files for convenience
